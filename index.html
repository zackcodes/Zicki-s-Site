		<h2>Who is he?</h2>
		<p>Zicki M is a middle school student who just turned 13. He is going into 8th grade and has an obsessions with being productive and making an impact on the world.
		He is a soundcloud rapper, and youtuber. He wants to influence others to join him on the journey of filth to legend and his target audience is young males from the age of 11-19, but everyone can get value from his content. This is just the demographic that he can most closely relate to. His journey began in 2020 when he gained a lot of weight during quarantine. He was ungrateful hateful and depressed. Even though he was a dopamine addict he was still depressed. In 2021 he decided to change, but he only really cared about the body, so he was lucky enough to just have random weight lifting equipment laying around, so he began using it and lost 40 -50 lbs. During this time he was still playing videogames and fapping all day, but then he realized that if he could improve one aspect of his life then he could improve the others. He tried, but then he would always go back to his old ways. He discovered youtubers such as Hamza and ICECOLD JT and grew disapointed when he couldn't seem to follow their advice, but then he realized something by watching their content. He had to fix his mental health, so he started to do this and he was able to get on nofap. Nofap led him to find a new place to direct this energy and he made music for a little bit and he developed this persona of ZICKI M and had a new ambition of becoming the god of this world and eliminating its filth, but he realized that he still had so much work to do so he got really serious and started eliminating his bad habits one by one using techniques discussed ina atomic habits and building good ones. He started taking working out more seriously and finally he started making excuses for why he couldn't start his youtube channel. He made a few unedited videos, but the end of the school year and getting a girlfriend led him to start slacking a little bitm but then he journaled about his slacking and declared that he would ascend so far above the filths during summer break. And after he started it he started getting even more serious about self improvement and right now it is the center of his life and the only thing he cares about and does.</p>
